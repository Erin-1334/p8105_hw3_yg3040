### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns. Variables include
weather station id, date of observation, (tenths of mm), snowfall (mm),
snow depth (mm), and min and max temperature (tenths of degrees C).

Below we clean the data, creating separate variables for year, month,
and day and converting `tmax` and `tmin` to numeric. We find that 0 is
the most commonly observed value for snowfall. This is because most days
of the year, it does not snow at all in NY. The second most commonly
observed value is `NA`, indicating missingness. Other common values are
13, 25, and 51, suggesting that snowfall is originally recorded in
fractions of an inch and converted to mm.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  count(snow) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    NA  381221
    ##  3    25   31022
    ##  4    13   23095
    ##  5    51   18274
    ##  6    76   10173
    ##  7     8    9962
    ##  8     5    9748
    ##  9    38    9197
    ## 10     3    8790
    ## # ℹ 272 more rows

``` r
ny_noaa = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax),
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin))
```

Below is a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
and in July in each station across years. As expected, the mean
temperature in January is much lower than the mean temperature in July
for all stations and across all years. All stations appear to follow
similar trends of temperature peaks and valleys within a month across
the years, i.e. when one station has a high monthly mean temperature for
a given year, most other stations also have a high monthly mean
temperature for that year. We do see one uncharacteristically cold
station in July of 1987 or 1988, as well as a few other less drastic
outliers.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE, color = id)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id)) + geom_point() + geom_path() +
  facet_grid(~month) +
  labs(title = "Mean monthly temperature for each station across years for January and July")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'id', 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

Below we show a two-panel plot including (i) a hex plot of `tmax` vs
`tmin` for the full dataset; and (ii) a ridge plot showing the
distribution of snowfall values (in mm) greater than 0 and less than 100
separately by year.

From the hex plot we see that while there is some variability, the
majority of the data cluster tightly in the center of the distribution.
In relatively rare cases, it seems that `tmax` is less than `tmin`,
which raises questions about data recording and quality.

From the ridge plot, we see a multimodal density of snowfall within a
given year. Most stations see between 0 and 35 mm of snow in a year.
Then there is a another group of stations that see about 45 mm of snow,
and another group that sees nearly 80 mm. It is likely this
multimodality stems from the conversion of measurements in one system
(fractions of an inch) to another (using the metric system), which was
also noted in the table of common values.

``` r
hex = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_hex()

ridge = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(snow < 100, snow > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = snow, y = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_density_ridges()

hex + ridge
```

### Problem 2

#### Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets.

``` r
covar_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/nhanes_covar.csv", 
    skip = 4, 
    na = c(".", "NA", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = factor(sex, labels = c("Male", "Female")),
    education = factor(education, labels = c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school"))
  )
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
accel_df = 
  read_csv(
    "data/nhanes_accel.csv", 
    na = c("0", ".", "NA", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "min",
    values_to = "mims")
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
final_df = 
  full_join(accel_df, covar_df, by = c("seqn")) |> 
  filter(age >= 21) |> 
  drop_na(sex, age, bmi, education) |>
  relocate(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education)
```

#### Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

``` r
covar_df |> 
  drop_na(sex, age, bmi, education) |> 
  janitor::tabyl(sex, education) |> 
  print()
```

    ##     sex Less than high school High school equivalent More than high school
    ##    Male                    27                     36                    56
    ##  Female                    28                     23                    59

``` r
covar_df |> 
  drop_na(sex, age, bmi, education) |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
      geom_density(alpha = .4, adjust = .5) +
      facet_grid(. ~ education)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yg3040_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />
*The number of men and women in “Less than high school” and “More than
high school”categories are alike. The number of men in “High school
equivalent” category is 50% larger than the number of women in “High
school equivalent” category.*

*The age distribution plot, divided by education levels and sex, reveals
distinct patterns. In the “Less than high school” group, men are more
prevalent in younger to middle adulthood (30–50 years), while women have
a slightly higher density in older age ranges (60+ years). The “High
school equivalent” group shows a more balanced distribution across ages,
but women outnumber men in the 70+ range. In the “More than high school”
group, the density of older women (around 70 years) is notably higher,
while men peak in middle adulthood (around 50 years), indicating that
women in this group tend to be older.*

#### Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

``` r
final_df |> 
  group_by(seqn) |> 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(mims)) |> 
  drop_na(sex, age, education) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(. ~ education) +
    labs(
      title = "Total Activity Against Age by Sex and Education",
      x = "Age",
      y = "Total Activity",
      color = "Sex"
    )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_yg3040_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />
\_

Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for
each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe in words
any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph; including
smooth trends may help identify differences.

``` r
final_df |> 
  drop_na(sex, education) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = mims, color = sex)) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(. ~ education) +
    labs(
      title = "24-Hour Activity Time Courses by Sex and Education",
      x = "Minute",
      y = "MIMS",
      color = "Sex"
    )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'
